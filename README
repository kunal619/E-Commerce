The project aims to provide an online platform for customers to purchase bakery products. 

The following are the key features of the project:
Customer Module: This module allows customers to register, log in, and browse bakery products. Customers can add products to their cart, place orders, and make payments online.

Admin Module: This module allows the bakery staff to manage the products, orders, and customers. The admin can add, edit, and delete products, view orders, and manage customer accounts.

The project uses Spring Boot to create a RESTful API that communicates with the front-end. JPA is used to map the Java objects to the database tables, and MySQL is used as the database.
The front-end of the project can be developed using React JS.The e-commerce project for the bakery is a full-stack web application developed using Spring Boot, JPA, JSP, Thymeleaf and MySQL.
